/**
 * Calculate the center of a circle that is defined by two points and a radius
 *
 * The algorithm works as follows:
 * -------------------------------------
 * There will be two circles with the same radius that can be +90째 and -90째 rotated around the line between the two points.
 * The two points and the circles with their radius and center points define a rhombus that is defined by a side length of the radius r.
 *
 * 1. Calculate the midpoint between the two points and the half distance (center of rhombus)
 * 2. The distance from both points to the center (radius) and the half distance between two points define a right triangle
 * 3. We use pythagoras to calculate the distance from the center of the rhombus to the center of the circle
 * 4. The new center point is the rhombus center + the output of step 3 rotated by +90째 or -90째
