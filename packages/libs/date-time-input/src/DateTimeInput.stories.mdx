# How to use the `@voloiq/date-time-input`

When adding a date time input to your UI, you have two options:

-   use the `DateTimeInput` component of `@volocopter/date-time-input-react`([see its story here](https://storybook.dev.voloiq.io/?path=/story/design-system-atoms-date-time-input--basic)) or
-   use the `DateTimeInput` component of `@voloiq/date-time-input`

In the first one you need to set the locale property manually in order to specify in what language the DateTimeInput is displayed.

The second one uses a provider that wraps around the component to specify the language. You don't need to set the locale property manually.

## Creating a DateTimeInput

<Canvas>
    <Story id="date-time-input-date-time-input--basic" />
</Canvas>

You need to wrap the DateTimeInput component with a `DateTimeInputLocaleProvider`. Here you need to set the property `currentLanguage`.

### `currentLanguage`: string

Indicates which language is used to display the calendar.

Everything else works the same in both libraries, so please have a look in the [documentation](https://storybook.dev.voloiq.io/?path=/docs/design-system-atoms-date-time-input--basic) of the DateTimeInput in the `@volocopter/date-time-input-react`.
