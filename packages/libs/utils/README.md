# @voloiq/utils

This library comprises useful and reusable frontend utilities.

## CONTRIBUTING

When you add a cool new helper to this library, please do the following:
- make sure to add documentation with JSDoc so we know at a glance what it does
- add tests so that we can use it with confidence!
- present it in the [Frontend Biweekly](https://confluence.volocopter.org/display/VIQ/Frontend+Biweekly)
so that everyone knows about and remembers it when they could use it! ;)
